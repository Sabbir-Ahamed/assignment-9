        <h1>Q2: What is semantic tag?</h1>
        <br />
        <p>
          Ans: Semantic tag help us to know about the content of website. That
          means , it describes clearly about website contents. Non-semantic tag
          can not describes about the websites content. Example: div and span -
          tells nothing about its content. but article , form , section , header
          , footer etc tells about their content properly.
        </p>

        <h1>Q3: Difference between inline , block and inline block element?</h1>
        <br />
        <p>
          Ans: Inline: In Inline element , any height width properties will no
          effect. Block: Block element will take full available width of
          browesers. Inline-block: It's formatted just like an inline element.
          but his behaviour will be block element.
